\chapter{Discussion}

As we work on this project in a team of 4 people, we divided the tasks. We did this by splitting into two groups of 2 people. The group with Gerald and Ruben used mostly one computer to program on. This worked very efficiently. The other group tried worked separately in the beginning but it ended up being easier for them to do the coding assignments on one computer as well. There was not a lot of communication between the groups. This was not necessary as we divided the tasks quite clearly (modules 1 and 2 for one group and modules 3 and 4 for the other). However, we could have shared more on how the progress was going, as it wasn't very clear how the progress in each group was going to the other. All in all, the collaboration was up to par, but improvements are possible. We tried to implement the scrum framework during the project, but as every programming assignment in the manual was worked on by both people within the sub groups, the division of work items became redundant.
