2. Damping at 2000.0 Hz is 45.98 dB.
3. This is indeed the case. If the peaks would shift, module 3 and 4 would not be able to detect the direction reliably.

## Assignments 4.3

1. In the end, we used a 2nd order Butterworth filter of length 5001.
2. The signal quality is pretty good. The band should be reduced to reduce the noise level, because less bandwidth gives less noise power.
