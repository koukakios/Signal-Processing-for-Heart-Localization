2. Damping at 2000.0 Hz is 45.98 dB.
3. This is indeed the case. If the peaks would shift, module 3 and 4 would not be able to detect the direction reliably.

## Assignments 4.3

1. In the end, we used a 2nd order Butterworth filter of length 5001.
2. The signal quality is pretty good. The band should be reduced to reduce the noise level, because less bandwidth gives less noise power.

**Disclaimer**: We suppose the systole is always longer than the diastole. Next to that, we also rely on the correct detection of all peaks, although the algorithm does not go fully into the error if it skips one. Could be detected by abnormal large/small distances.
